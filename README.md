docs(coc.txt): Correct spelling `resutl` to `result`

Correct spelling error in doc/coc.txt, Line: 2379<br>
resutl was corrected to result

```text
When callback function exists as the last argument, the callback
function is called with `error` string as the first argument and
  -	`resutl` as the second argument.  When no callback exists, error
  +	`result` as the second argument.  When no callback exists, error
message would be echoed.

Chceckout |coc-actions| for available actions.
